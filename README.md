# PasswordGenerator
Given that your password is the first line of defense over any of your accounts the value of having a strong password cannot be overstated. Often times, and I've been guilty of it myself, we use things like names, dates, favorite songs etc to create our passwords. A strong password wouldn't include any of these things and so, using the .Net Framework's Random class, this app will generate you a random password based on the requirements you give it. Eventually, I would like to address the biggest issue of random passwords, remembering them!

# To Do:
* Link db for password storage
* Implement password length functionality
* Improve security by NOT hard-coding 12345 as the password to enter the app
